Three files to create FRAP curves from in vitro condensates (should also work on in vivo data)
The config.ijm is a Fiji/ImageJ macro intended to properly scale and label the data
The export.py can be used as a Jython script in Fiji/ImageJ to calculate and export (.csv) FRAP intensities from selected ROI's
The plotting.py is intended to plot the FRAP curves nicely (since Fiji/ImageJ plots look garbage)
