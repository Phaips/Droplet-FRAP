Three files to create FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching) curves

The config.ijm is a Fiji/ImageJ macro intended to properly scale and label the data (ideal for biomolecular condensates)

The export.py can be used as a Jython script in Fiji/ImageJ to calculate and export (.csv) FRAP intensities from selected ROI's

The plotting.py is intended to plot the FRAP curves nicely (since Fiji/ImageJ plots look garbage)
